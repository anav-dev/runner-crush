  The calming effect of blue colors can contribute to a sense of relaxation and stress relief for users, aiding in maintaining a strong focus on the game.
  
  Different sunflower yellow tones were used to add contrast to the site to ensure accessibility as well as to add a joy sense, improving the game use.
